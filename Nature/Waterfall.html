        <h1>Panthumai Waterfall</h1>
        <h2>Untouchable beauty</h2>
        <img class="Ian" src="Image/pangthumai-waterfall.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Panthumai – a village from West Jaflong Union under Guainghat Upazilla – is another tourism hub in Sylhet. The village, which is very near to the east Khasia hill of the Meghalaya ranges, boasts of an eye-catching fall popularly known as Borhill Fall. Though the main fall is geographically located in the Indian territory, people can enjoy its enormous splendour head-on. Flowing from the Borhill Fall is a branch of the river Piyain that heads west and leads to Bisnakandi, another major tourist spot. <br> In addition to the splendid fall, the Guainghat-Pangthumai Road itself is a sight for the sore eye. As one heads east, the enormous mountain ranges appear to come closer and turn from blue to green gradually. And the clouds and the falls playing hide and seek are sure to fill one with awe. The best possible time to visit Pangthumai is between April and mid-October. </p>
